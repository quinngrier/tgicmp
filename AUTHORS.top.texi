This file contains a list of people who have worked on TGICMP@.
The list is chronological and summarizes each person's activity. Each
person's commit count generally indicates how much work they have done,
but this should be taken with a grain of salt as some people prefer to
divide their work into smaller, more numerous commits than others. The
intent is only to paint an overall picture of the project's authorship.

The list is generated from the TGICMP Git repository,
which contains the complete historical record of the project. The
repository should be easy to find by searching the Internet or by
visiting one of the following mirrors:
