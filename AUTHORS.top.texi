This file contains a list of people who have worked on TGICMP@.
The list is in chronological order and also summarizes each person's
activity. A person's commit count generally indicates how much work they
have done but should be taken with a grain of salt as some people spread
equal work over more commits than others. The commit count is also shown
as the percentage of all commits.

The list is generated from the TGICMP Git repository,
which contains the complete history of the project. For information on
downloading the repository, see the @file{MIRRORS} file or the Mirrors
appendix of the manual.

The list follows.
