This file contains a list of people who have worked on TGICMP@.
The list is in chronological order and also summarizes each person's
activity. A person's commit count generally indicates how much work they
have done but should be taken with a grain of salt as some people divide
their work into smaller commits than others. The commit count is also
shown as the percentage of all commits.

The list is generated from the TGICMP Git repository,
which contains the complete historical record of the project. The
repository should be easy to find by searching the Internet or by
visiting one of the following mirrors:
