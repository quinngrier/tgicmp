.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tgicmp.h
header defines six macros for performing type-generic
integer comparisons. If the header is included, it reserves the macro
names for use as specified. The header can be included multiple times
without any problems.
.LP
The six macros are
.BR TGILT ,
.BR TGIGT ,
.BR TGILE ,
.BR TGIGE ,
.BR TGIEQ ,
and
.BR TGINE ,
which
correspond to the usual comparison operators
.BR < ,
.BR > ,
.BR <= ,
.BR >= ,
.BR == ,
and
.BR != ,
respectively. Each macro takes two arguments
.I x
and
.IR y .
Each of
.I x
and
.I y
must be an integer expression. Invalid arguments, in particular those
with real floating type, always cause syntax errors. The macro expands
to a parenthesized integer
.I expression
with type
.B int
and value 1 if the
corresponding comparison between
.I x
and
.I y
is conceptually true, or 0 if
not. Both
.I x
and
.I y
may be evaluated more than once. If both
.I x
and
.I y
are
constant expressions, so is the resulting
.IR expression .
If both
.I x
and
.I y
are suitable for use in preprocessing directives, so is the resulting
.IR expression .
