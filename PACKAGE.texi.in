@c This input file (PACKAGE.texi.in) helps to create DATE and VERSION
@c variables for Texinfo by using the PACKAGE_DATE and PACKAGE_VERSION
@c variables from Autotools (note that the PACKAGE_DATE variable is not
@c predefined). Adjust the following code for your Makefile.am file and
@c use @include PACKAGE.texi:
@c
@c   $(builddir)/PACKAGE.texi: $(srcdir)/PACKAGE.texi.in
@c   	sed -e 's|@PACKAGE_DATE[@]|$(PACKAGE_DATE)|g'       \
@c   	    -e 's|@PACKAGE_VERSION[@]|$(PACKAGE_VERSION)|g' \
@c   	    $? >$@
@c
@c   EXTRA_DIST += $(srcdir)/PACKAGE.texi.in
@c

@set DATE @PACKAGE_DATE@
@set VERSION @PACKAGE_VERSION@
